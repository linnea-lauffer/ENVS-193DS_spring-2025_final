# ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final
This repository conains my final project submission for ENVS 193DS, Spring 2025

## Overview:

Problem 1 focuses on improving statistical communication and rewriting research statements about nitrogen loading in the San Joaquin River Delta.

Problem 2 explores the long-term seasonal patterns in sea surface temperature from 2018 to 2023 in the Santa Barbara Channel. 

Problem 3 analyzes Swift Parrot nest box occupancy to understand how distance from forest edge and breeding season affect nesting patterns. 

Problem 4 compares exploratory and affective visualizations of personal sleep data, highlighting patterns in sleep duration and reflecting on visual design. 

## Folders:

Data Folder (data/): Contains all the datasets used in this project, including sea surface temperature data and nest box ccupancy data. The sea surface temperature data includes variables such as date, site, latitude, longitude, and temperature. The nest box occupancy data includes relevant variables such as box, box oxcupant, box distance from forest edge, season, repeated use of the box, and species occupancy. 

Code Folder (code/): Contains the Quarto document, ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final.qmd that performs data cleaning, analysis, modeling, visualization, and interpretation across all four problems.
